# NYC Subway Data (Project 1)

This is a project created to satisfy the requirement of the Udacity Nanodegree for Data Science. It address the first problemset: ridership on the NYC Subway.

## Files

There are four images used in the answer essay, and they're included externally here.

Also, the zip's are each iteration I've taken through submitting this project. `Short Questions.odt` and `Project 1 - Short Questions.pdf` are the most current submission.

## Troublespots

I had a lot of trouble trying to understand exactly how to interpret R2. It seemed to be something that having the benefit of experience would greatly help on, but after reading a ton of articles about R2, I think I have a better understanding of it now.

I am still not sure I fully understand how dummy variables are actually used. I feel like I have a good understanding of what they are, but I don't understand how they affect the creation of our linear regression model in Python, or even why I have so many dummy variables.
